I animated water blocks using two different sine functions, one based on time and the x position, and another based on time and the y position, for a more natural wave effect, and added subtle wiggling to assets like grass and flowers to bring the scene to life."}),e.jsx("h3",{className:n.subheading,children:"ðŸ›  Technical Challenges & Highlights"}),e.jsx("p",{className:n.description,children:"This project helped me deepen my understanding of procedural content generation, GPU rendering pipelines, and optimizing rendering order for transparent objects.
